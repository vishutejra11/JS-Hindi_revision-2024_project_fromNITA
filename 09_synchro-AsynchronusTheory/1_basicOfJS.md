# Javascript 

1.Javascript is Synchronus language.
(Code Excute line by line)

2.Single threaded :-
 Means no multiple thread execution at a time.

 // The above is a default behaviour of Js.

 # Execution Context:

 Execute one line of code a time -
 ```
   console.log(a) // 1 execution order
   console.log(b) // 2 

   :- each operation waits for the 
   last one to complete before executing.
   ```

 1.Block the flow of Program. ||1. Does not block execution
 2.Read file Sync.            ||2. Read file Async
